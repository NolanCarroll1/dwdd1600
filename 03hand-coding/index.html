    <h1>Overview</h1>
   <p>
    Magic: The Gathering is a strategy card game made by Wizards of the Coast. It has sometimes been described as a mix of poker and chess due to it's complexity and the inherent variablitity of a card game. It has been around for over 30 years and as such has a <i>lot</i> to take in for someone who is new. This website aims to help <strong>you</strong> learn to play! Our first step will be to look at the different card types. 
   </p>
    <p>Card types can be split into two main categories:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Lands</li>
        <li>Spells</li>   
       </ul>
       
   <h2>Lands</h2>
       <p>Lands are the most basic resource in the game. There are six basic lands that correspond to the five colors of mana in Magic plus an additional basic land that creates "colorless" mana. Each of the basics, and the mana they produce, are:</p>
       <dl>
           <dt>Plains-</dt> <dd>White</dd>
           <dt>Islands-</dt> <dd>Blue</dd>
           <dt>Swamps-</dt> <dd>Black</dd>
           <dt>Mountains-</dt> <dd>Red</dd>
           <dt>Forests-</dt> <dd>Green</dd>
           <dt>Wastes-</dt> <dd>Colorless</dd>
       </dl>
       <h3>Playing Lands</h3>
       <p>Innately you may play one land per turn on either of your <a href="turns.html#mainphase">mainphases.</a>They can be "tapped" or used(indicated by turnning the card sidways on the table) to create one mana that is primarily used to cast spells. A deck ideally has enough lands in it to play one per turn so that you can cast more mana expesive spells or more spells per turn. </p>
       <h2>Spells</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>Creatures</li> <li>Artifacts</li> <li>Enchantments</li> <li>Instants</li> <li>Soceries</li> <li>Planeswalkers</li> <li>Battles</li></ul>
